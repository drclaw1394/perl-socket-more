Revision history for Perl extension Socket::More.
v0.5.0  2023-09-30
  [features]
    - Removed runtime dependancie on Socket
    - Networking related constants contained in Socket::More::Constants
    - IP grouping/ranges refactored into seperate module
      -TODO load at when required or implement own group code

    - Implemented getaddrinfo and getnameinfo
    - Implemented pack/unpack_sockaddr_un/in/in6 and sockaddr_family
    - Implemented gai_strerror
        
    - TODO update pod with new functions
      - calling convention is different to socket

    - TODO fix error setting for $!
    - TODO fix integer value for port number

    [imporvements]
      - reduced memory overhead but not requiring Socket
      - reduce memeory overhead by only processing ip ranges/groups when asked
        for in sockaddr_passive specificaiton


v0.4.3 2023-09-05
  [changes]
    - All symbols are exported by default. No longer need the :all tag
    - All symbols from Socket module are exported into callers name unless
      called with use Socket::More ()
  

  [improvements]
    - Refactored to remove dependencies List::Util, Sort::Key::Multi and carp
    - Exporting symbols with Export::These  for easy reexport of  Socket
      symbols
    - Updated CI config
    

v0.4.2 2023-05-27
  [tests]
  - Disabled failing 'localhost' test. Incorrectly assumed a host with IPv6
    had a loopback interface with IPv6 addressing enabled

v0.4.1 2023-05-24
  [tests]
  - Fixed bud in test script. Incorrect label for skipping IPV6 tests when no
    IPv6 available

v0.4.0 2023-05-23
  [improvements]
  - strings names can be used instead of AF_ and SOCK_ constants directly in
    sockaddr_passive. Removes the need to 'use Socket...' for many use cases.
    This was only possible when using the parse_passive_spec function
    previously

  [fixes]
  - with the new string name feature, operates mores as described in the
    documentation

  [tests]
  - updated tests to cover new string names feature in sockaddr_passive

0.3.0 2022-12-19T13:23:31ZAEST

  [Features]
  - Added reify_ports function 
    Replaces all 0 port (any port) in specifications with a single real one
    supplied by the OS. Shared amongst other 0 port entires in the same call.

  - Added reify_ports_unshared function
    Replaces all 0 port (any port) in specifications with a real one supplied
    by the OS, likely different (not shared) for each entry in specifications.

  [Documentation]
  - Documented reify_ports and reify_ports_unshared

  - Reworded some the POD sections

  [Bug fixes]
  - Suppressed 'uninitialised' warnings in specification testing.
  - More consistent handling of host:port CLI syntax when port is missing.
  - Fixed Changes file format

0.2.0 2022-11-25T08:20:29ZAEST 

  [Bug fixes]

	- Attempting to fix failing tests
	  Removed interface index mapping tests due to possible race condition
	  Conditionally perform a couple of tests relating to IPv6, only if IPv6 is available
	 
	- Actually runs on FreeBSD now
	  In generating the string to integer mapping for the SOCK_* constants,
	  SOCK_CLOEXEC and SOCK_NONBLOCK where also added. These are large
	  integers intended to be use as a mask, not a socket type. These are
	  filtered out of the mapping now to prevent all your memory being
	  consumed!

  [Features]

	- Added has_IPv4_interface and has_IPv6_interface routines to help test if
	  IPv4/IPv6 is available on at least one interface

	- Reduces memory usage
	  Replaced Net::IP with Net::IP::Lite;
	  Direct copy of IP required 'group' table and functions from Net::IP
	  Replaced Test::Deep with Data::Cmp
	  Only Load Scalar::Util when using socket

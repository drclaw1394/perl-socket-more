Revision history for Perl extension Socket::More.

0.2.0  Fri Nov 25 08:20:29 AEST 2022
	- Reduces memory usage
	  Replaced Net::IP with Net::IP::Lite;
	  Direct copy of IP required 'group' table and functions from Net::IP
	  Replaced Test::Deep with Data::Cmp
	  Only Load Scalar::Util when using socket

	- Attempting to fix failing tests
	  Removed interface index mapping tests due to possible race condition
	  Conditionally perform a couple of tests relating to IPv6, only if IPv6 is available
	 
	- Actually runs on FreeBSD now
	  In generating the string to integer mapping for the SOCK_* constants,
	  SOCK_CLOEXEC and SOCK_NONBLOCK where also added. These are large
	  integers intended to be use as a mask, not a socket type. These are
	  filtered out of the mapping now to previent all your memory being
	  consumed!

	- Added has_IPv4_interface and has_IPv6_interface routines to help test if
	  IPv4/IPv6 is available on at least one interface
